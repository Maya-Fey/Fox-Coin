Historical code repository for the 2014 Cryptocurrency Foxcoin (FOX). The original GitHub version of this repository was deleted in shame, this new one is a complete restoration, except for a minor rebase to remove private information that was mistakenly included during the original development process.

If you find the commit history confusing, don't feel bad. I didn't understand anything about git when I wrote this, nor did I know that git and GitHub were actually separate things. I thought that git was just 'the place where the files go'. 

Given that I was a young teenager when I did this, I'm pretty proud of myself. If anyone is interested in the mildly short, temultuous history of FoxCoin, do read the linked bitcointalk thread. There you can find all my confusions and mistakes I made in my first ever cryptocurrency launch.
